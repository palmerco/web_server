<blockquote>
There's something profoundly optimistic about teaching. We are taking the best of what humans have to give - lifetimes of knowledge, wisdom, craft, and art - and handing it over to the next generation, with the hope that they will continue to build, continue to make our world better. It's a conversation with our past and future selves at once, a way of saying, look what we've done! Now what will you do with it?
