Hi, Iâ€™m Cody! I am an electrical engineer from Dayton, Ohio, which has been my home for the past 6 years. I earned a B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Wright State University. While in college, I was fortunate enough to be a part of a life-changing internship at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), where I was directly involved in research regarding wireless communications. This internship helped pave the path for my current position as an electrical engineer at Dynetics Inc., where I research, model, and simulate radar systems.

<blockquote>
There's something profoundly optimistic about teaching. We are taking the best of what humans have to give - lifetimes of knowledge, wisdom, craft, and art - and handing it over to the next generation, with the hope that they will continue to build, continue to make our world better. It's a conversation with our past and future selves at once, a way of saying, look what we've done! Now what will you do with it?
