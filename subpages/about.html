<p>
Hi, I’m Cody! I am an electrical engineer and am currently exploring teaching opportunities within engineering near Dayton, Ohio.
</p>


<p>
I am a creative person who finds joy in learning and problem solving. Here's a short list of words that reflect my character: 

<span style="color:#ff6347">  calculated</span>,
<span style="color:#ff6347"> diligent</span>, 
<span style="color:#ff6347"> collaborative</span>,
<span style="color:#ff6347"> persistent</span>,
<span style="color:#ff6347"> reliable</span>,
and 
<span style="color:#ff6347"> organized</span>.
</p>



<p>
My teaching philosophy is to create an inclusive educational environment that challenges students to retain confidence in their ability to solve difficult problems and become life-long learners.
</p>

		There's something profoundly optimistic about teaching. We are taking the best of what humans have to give - lifetimes of knowledge, wisdom, craft, and art - and handing it over to the next generation, with the hope that they will continue to build, continue to make our world better. It's a conversation with our past and future selves at once, a way of saying, look what we've done! Now what will you do with it?
