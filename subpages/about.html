<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm Cody, and welcome to my personal website. I decided several years ago to challenge myself to create a website. As you may have already noticed, I do not post regularly, but rather use this as a platform to keep a copy of my resume accessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently work as a Lead Systems Engineer with BWI Group in Dayton, Ohio. No two days are the same at BWI, and I enjoy problem solving the various challenges that come my way. I work with many different tools, but MATLAB is by far my favorite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the type of engineer who doesn&rsquo;t stop thinking about a problem until it&rsquo;s solved, which has led to many restless nights. But problem solving is my passion and I enjoy the learning process along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V/r,</p>
<p>Cody</p>
