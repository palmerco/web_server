<p>
Hey! I’m Cody. I am an electrical engineer currently located in Dayton, OH. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
I currently work as a Systems Test Engineer at BWI Group in Dayton, OH. I started this position in March 2022 after relocating back from Los Angeles, California. My day-to-day job includes developing and executing regression tests for our Electronic Control Unit (ECU) requirements on the Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) system. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Prior to BWI, I specialized in signal processing, systems engineering, and MATLAB development. I enjoy information theory and the practice of modulating/demodulating signals since it is the foundation to sharing data in our daily lives.

		There's something profoundly optimistic about teaching. We are taking the best of what humans have to give - lifetimes of knowledge, wisdom, craft, and art - and handing it over to the next generation, with the hope that they will continue to build, continue to make our world better. It's a conversation with our past and future selves at once, a way of saying, look what we've done! Now what will you do with it?
