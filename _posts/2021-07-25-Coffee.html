Heritage tracing and rating my go-to coffees from 2013 - 2021

<p> <br> --- </p>

<p>Oh coffee… arguably Earth’s most valuable resource has positively impacted my life so much that it wins first post! </p>

<p>I didn’t begin drinking coffee until my freshman year of college (2013), which is when I discovered Starbucks’ Mocha Frappuccino. At first, it was awful - like many unfamiliar drinks. But, sometime between study sessions in the café, long shifts at Pacsun, and road trips with friends… I fell in love.   </p>

<p>As expected, my palate has deviated throughout the years, so I thought it would be fun to trace and rate my “go-to” coffees since the beginning. </p>

<p>Special shout out to the Starbucks baristas (2013-2018) on Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio. You’ve brought a copious amount of joy to my life.  </p>

<p>Let’s get to it! </p>
